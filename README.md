# Snake-Game
C++ implementation of snake game

Instructions:
Objective: The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat as much food as possible and avoid crashing into walls or the snake's own body.

Controls:

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
Alternatively, you can use the WASD keys (W for up, A for left, S for down, D for right) for movement.

Gameplay:

The snake will start with a length of 1 and will increase in length each time it eats food.
Food will appear randomly on the game board. The snake must navigate to the food to eat it.
Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer, increasing the challenge of avoiding collisions.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
Scoring:

Your score increases each time the snake eats food.
The longer the snake grows, the higher your score will be.
